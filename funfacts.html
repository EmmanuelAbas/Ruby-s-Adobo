   Fun facts about each ingredients
      <ol>
        <li>Pork Liempo:Did you know that pork liempo, or pork belly, is one of the most versatile cuts of pork? It can be grilled, roasted, fried, or braised, and it’s the star of many iconic dishes around the world—like crispy lechon kawali in the Philippines, Korean samgyeopsal, and Chinese char siu! Its perfect balance of meat and fat is what makes it so flavorful and juicy.</li>
        <li>Garlic:It’s known as the "stinking rose" because of its strong smell, but did you know that garlic was once used as currency? In ancient Egypt, garlic was so highly valued that it was used to pay workers, including those who built the pyramids! Plus, its health benefits—like boosting immunity and improving heart health—make it as powerful as it is pungent.</li>
        <li>Onion:Ancient Egyptians revered onions so much that they used them in burial rituals! They believed the circular layers symbolized eternity, so onions were often placed in tombs or even on the eyes of mummies. Also, onions are one of the oldest cultivated crops, with evidence of them being grown over 5,000 years ago!</li> 
        <li>Whole peppercorns:In the Middle Ages, they were so valuable they were called "black gold" and even used as currency! Peppercorns were often traded for goods or used to pay rent and taxes. This spice's popularity and demand even helped drive global exploration, including the spice trade routes. Plus, they pack a punch of flavor and are key in many cuisines worldwide!</li>
        <li>long green chilis:While it's commonly used in Filipino dishes like *sinigang* and *Bicol Express*, it's actually not very spicy compared to other chili varieties. In fact, its mild heat makes it perfect for adding just the right kick to dishes without overpowering the flavors. Fun bonus: Chili plants are self-pollinating, meaning they can produce fruit on their own without needing another plant! </li>
        <li>Red chili peppers:They owe their spiciness to a compound called capsaicin, which not only brings the heat but also triggers the release of endorphins in your brain—making you feel a natural "chili high"! Also, did you know that chili peppers were one of the first crops domesticated in the Americas over 6,000 years ago? Today, they’re a staple in cuisines worldwide, from fiery Thai curries to smoky Mexican salsas!</li>
        <li>Ground Black pepper:It’s often called the “king of spices” and has been traded for over 4,000 years, making it one of the oldest and most widely used spices in the world! In ancient times, it was so prized that it was used as a sacred offering, and even as ransom—when the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 AD, part of the ransom they demanded was 3,000 pounds of black pepper!</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise:It was supposedly invented by accident in 1756 when a French chef ran out of cream while making a sauce for the Duke of Richelieu. He improvised with eggs and oil, creating the creamy condiment we love today! Fun bonus: Mayonnaise is an amazing emulsifier because of the lecithin in egg yolks, which helps blend oil and water into a smooth mixture. It’s not just for sandwiches—people even use it for baking super moist cakes!  </li>
        <li>Cooking Oil:It’s not just for frying and sautéing—it’s also been used historically for preserving food! Ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Romans used olive oil to store vegetables, cheese, and even fish by submerging them in the oil to keep out air and bacteria. Another cool tidbit: Different oils have different smoke points, which is why oils like avocado and peanut are great for high-heat cooking, while others like sesame and flaxseed are best for drizzling or low-heat dishes.</li>
