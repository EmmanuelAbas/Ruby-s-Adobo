    Red hot Pork Sisig Recipe and procedures to cook by Chef Ruby!
    <p class="smallTitle"> First of all what is Sisig and it's History?</p>
    <p class="p1">Sisig, a well-loved Filipino dish, originated in Pampanga and has a rich history dating back to the 1700s. The term "sisig" is derived from the Kapampangan word meaning "to snack on something sour," as the original versions of the dish involved fruits or vegetables marinated in vinegar and salt. Over time, it evolved into a savory dish using pig's head and ears boiled, grilled, and mixed with vinegar, calamansi, onions, and spices.
      In the 1970s, Lucia "Aling Lucing" Cunanan from Angeles City transformed sisig into the sizzling version we know today by grilling the ingredients and serving them hot. This innovation helped popularize sisig across the Philippines and globally, with variations including chicken, seafood, and tofu. The dish has become a cultural symbol and is celebrated annually in Pampanga's Sisig Festival.
